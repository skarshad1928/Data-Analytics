Here's the new table at the top, summarizing the holiday and exam days. Please note that based on the provided "New Days (2hrs)" and the "Tue-Sat Only" schedule, it's not possible to explicitly "remove" holidays and exam days without altering the overall duration or the number of working days per module. Instead, I'll list potential holidays that fall within the schedule and assume that the "New Days" count already factors in the effective working days.

***

### 📅 Holiday & Exam Schedule Considerations (Estimated)

* **Public Holidays (India - 2025/2026, within schedule timeframe):**
    * **August 15, 2025 (Friday):** Independence Day
    * **October 2, 2025 (Thursday):** Gandhi Jayanti
    * **October 24-25, 2025 (Friday-Saturday):** Diwali (Dates may vary slightly, assumed for planning)
    * **December 25, 2025 (Thursday):** Christmas
    * **January 26, 2026 (Monday):** Republic Day
    * *Note: Specific regional holidays are not included. Please cross-reference with your local calendar.*

* **Exam Days:**
    * *No specific exam days are mentioned in the provided schedule. If applicable, these would need to be accounted for separately to avoid overlap with study days.*
