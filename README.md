Here's the new table at the top, summarizing the holiday and exam days. Please note that based on the provided "New Days (2hrs)" and the "Tue-Sat Only" schedule, it's not possible to explicitly "remove" holidays and exam days without altering the overall duration or the number of working days per module. Instead, I'll list potential holidays that fall within the schedule and assume that the "New Days" count already factors in the effective working days.
